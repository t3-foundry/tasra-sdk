# Changelog

All notable changes to this package are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this package follows
semantic versioning with one pre-1.0 caveat: a minor bump may change the API, a patch
never does.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-22

### Added

- Per-commitment accountant seeds for faster slot creation on compatible deployments,
  with beacon-epoch fallback when a seed is unavailable.
- `requestSlotSeed`, `resolveAccountantUrls`, `ACCOUNTANT_TAG`, and the
  `SlotSeed`, `SlotSeedOptions`, and `CommitRevealOptions` types in `tasra-sdk/chain`.
- Seed-request options and a `seeded` result flag on `createSlotCommitReveal`.

### Changed

- Commit/reveal slot creation tries a seeded reveal before waiting for the beacon.
  A failed seeded reveal through a relay propagates its error to preserve relay retries.
- KeyRegistry ABI includes seeded reveal methods, `commitSeedDigest`, and related
  events and errors.

## [0.1.0]

Initial release of `tasra-sdk`: a TypeScript access layer for the Tasra network.
